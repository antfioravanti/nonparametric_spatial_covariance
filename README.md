# Nonparametric Spatial Covariance estimator
Simulations on the Nonparametric Spatial Covariance estimator as presented in Properties of nonparametric estimators of autocovariance for stationary random fields by Peter Hall and Prakash Patil.

### Version 1
Original Simulations
### Version 2 
Simulations with consideration for specific points.
Namely, we select 3 points:
	- "Many": a point with many neighbouring points
	- "Few": a point with few neighbouring points
	- "Border": a point at the border of the grid
	
For each of the above point, we select:
	- "Closest": the closest point in Eucleadean distance
	- "Furthest": the furthest point in Eucleadean distance
	- "Medium": a point in the middle of the Eucleadean distance
	
### Version 3
_IN PROGRESS_
Refactor of the simulation for parallel computing.
